This is just a simple project to control a stepper motor with a small 8-pin
attiny25/45/85 microcontroller. The microcontroller has 5 pins for I/O, 1 pin
for a UART RX, 4 pins for controlling the stepper motor.

The UART RX is implemented by sampling the RX pin with in an interrupt running
at 4X the desired baudrate. In this instance the baudrate is configured to
be 2400.

Stepper control is done using TIMER0.
